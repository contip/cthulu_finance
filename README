The idea is to implement the CS50x finance application, only using node.js
instead of python and flask.  Since I just learned about node.js recently.

Decide on a framework to use (e.g. nest) for the server part.  And instead
of using something like handlebars... try to use react or angular

Then just replicate everything they did in python with flask, node.


first goal:

write handler for POST request
