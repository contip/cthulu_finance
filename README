The idea is to implement something like the CS50x finance application:

https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/finance/

using nest js and react with typescript instead of flask and python.
The reason is that I have taken a web dev course recently, and would like to 
apply some of the skills (js / node) I learned in that course.  I would also 
like to learn react.

The CS50x project itself is presented as mostly pre-built, with the user to 
finish writing several incomplete functions.  This project aims to implement 
everything from scratch and use none of the CS50 code (except for, perhaps, 
the html layout of the main app page).

current goal:

continue w/ frontend auth -- add protected routes component to wrap other 
routes
