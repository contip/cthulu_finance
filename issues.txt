-user registration:
    if user goes to registration page and clicks in the input field
    then clicks out of the field, react will submit a POST request with
    a BLANK value for lookup request, throwing error server-side
    
-stock lookup/purchase/sell:
	must consistently check that capitalization is handled FOR EVERY
	COMPONENT IN THE APPLICATION
	* sell requests fail for lowercase stock symbols
	
	invalid lookups (valid strings but not valid stock symbols) return
	500 internal server errors from the server instead of 400 bad request
	or XXX not found
